Homework 7 - Train Scheduler

This project allows you to add a train to the schedule and see when the next train will arrive.

Enter the following information into the form:

* Train Name

* Destination 

* First Train Time -- in military time

* Frequency -- in minutes

The page will generate a record for it in the table, and tell you when the next train arrives.
